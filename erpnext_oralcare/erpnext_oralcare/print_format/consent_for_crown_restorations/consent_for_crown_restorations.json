Crowns can also be placed to change the bite or for cosmetic purposes. Crowns usually require at least two to three visits for the entire treatment to be completed. At the first visit, the dentist will reduce the size of the tooth. This makes room for the crown itself to fit on the remaining portion of tooth, called the preparation. After the reduction is completed, an impression or a mould of the preparation is made using a rubbery material. A plastic temporary crown is held on the tooth with temporary cement while the crown restoration is being made by a dental laboratory. It is important to return for the cementation of the new crown as soon as it is ready in order to reduce the chance of re-decay or other problems.\\n<br><br>\\nThis recommendation is based on visual examination(s), on any X-rays, models, photos and other diagnostic tests taken, and on my doctor's knowledge of my medical and dental history.
