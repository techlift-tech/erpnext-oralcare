It is commonly performed procedure in everyday practice and gives a 2dimentional (2-D) image. Dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a special type of x-ray equipment used when regular dental or facial x-rays are not sufficient. This technology produces three dimensional (3-D) images of teeth, soft tissues, nerve pathways and bone in a single scan.\\n<br>\\n<p><b><br>\\nInstructions :</b></p> <p>I am aware and have been informed that prior to the examination, I may be asked to remove anything that may interfere with the imaging, including metal objects, such as jewellery, eyeglasses, hairpins and hearing aids including removable dental prosthesis.</p>\\n<br><p><b>\\nProcedure:<p> </b><p>I have been explained that during a panoramic x-ray examination, the x-ray tube rotates in a semicircle around the patient's head, starting at one side of the jaw and ending at the other side. In CBCT examination, the C-arm or gantry rotates around the head in a complete 360-degree rotation while capturing multiple images from different angles that are reconstructed to create a single 3-D image. I am aware that I will be situated in the center of the unit where the technician will carefully position me. A bite-blocker will be placed in my mouth to ensure proper alignment of the teeth. Correct placement of the teeth and head is important for obtaining a clear image. Also I am expected to remain very still while the rotating arm travels in a semicircle around the perimeter of my head when the images are being taken. This can typically last between 10 to 40 seconds.</p>\\n\", \"fieldname\": \"_custom_html\", \"fieldtype\": \"HTML\", \"label\": \"Custom HTML\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"options\": \"<br><br><b>Declaration:</b> The risks involved and the possibility of complications if any during this procedure have been explained to me.\", \"fieldname\": \"_custom_html\", \"fieldtype\": \"HTML\", \"label\": \"Custom HTML\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Section Break\", \"label\": \"\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Column Break\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"options\": \"<br><b>I acknowledge that:</b>\", \"fieldname\": \"_custom_html\", \"fieldtype\": \"HTML\", \"label\": \"Custom HTML\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Section Break\", \"label\": \"\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Column Break\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"fieldname\": \"could_be_pregnant\", \"label\": \"There could be a possibility that I could be pregnant\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"fieldname\": \"pregnant\", \"label\": \"I am  pregnant\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"fieldname\": \"not_claustrophobic\", \"label\": \"I am not Claustrophobic\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Column Break\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"fieldname\": \"nursing_mother\", \"label\": \"I am a nursing mother\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"fieldname\": \"epileptic\", \"label\": \"I am not Epileptic\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"fieldname\": \"i_am_not_pregnant\", \"label\": \"I am Not Pregnant\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Section Break\", \"label\": \"\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Column Break\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"options\": \"<br>\\n<br>\\n<b>Risks of Radiological imaging</b>\\n<br>\\n\\nI have been informed and completely understand that there are certain inherent and potential risks associated with radiological imaging. These risks are difficult to accurately measure, but it has been shown that the risk of developing cancer is slightly increased if one has been exposed to additional ionising radiation above background levels. The risks are not the same for all people; females and Children are slightly more sensitive to the effects of ionising radiation compared with males. Although there is a small risk of harm from ionising radiation, there could be a greater risk of not having the information. Operators of an X-ray machine have been trained to use only enough X-rays to provide quality pictures for the specialist. The dose of ionising radiation is therefore kept to a minimum.
