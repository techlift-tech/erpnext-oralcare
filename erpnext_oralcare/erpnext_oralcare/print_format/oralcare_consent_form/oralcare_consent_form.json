Crowns can also be placed to change the bite or for cosmetic purposes. Crowns usually require at least two to three visits for the entire treatment to be completed. At the first visit, the dentist will reduce the size of the tooth. This makes room for the crown itself to fit on the remaining portion of tooth, called the preparation. After the reduction is completed, an impression or a mould of the preparation is made using a rubbery material. A plastic temporary crown is held on the tooth with temporary cement while the crown restoration is being made by a dental laboratory. It is important to return for the cementation of the new crown as soon as it is ready in order to reduce the chance of re-decay or other problems. <br><br>\n            This recommendation is based on visual examination(s), on any X-rays, models, photos and other diagnostic tests taken, and on my doctor's knowledge of my medical and dental history.

I understand that it is possible for an infection to occur or an existing infection to worsen in the tooth being treated and/or in the area around the tooth, and that I may need antibiotics and/or other procedures to treat the infection.  <br><br>\nI understand that root canal instruments sometimes separate (break) inside the canal. This is more likely when canals are curved and/or narrowed. If the separated fragment cannot be retrieved, it may require sealing inside the root canal. It also may be necessary to have oral surgery performed on the tooth root (apicoectomy) to address the problem.  <br><br>\nI understand that a separated instrument often decreases the likelihood of clinical success.  <br><br>  \nI understand that other risks include: perforation of the tooth or tooth root by an instrument; injury to soft tissues adjacent to the tooth; sinus perforation; and nerve disturbances such as temporary or permanent numbness, itching, burning, or tingling of the lip, tongue, chin, teeth, and /or mouth tissues. <br><br> <br><br> \n\n <p style=\"text-align: right\">{{ frappe.db.get_value(\"Patient\", doc.patient, \"patient_name\") }}<br>\nPatient's Name & Signature</p><br>\n\n{% elif doc.procedure == 'Periodontal' %}\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b> Nature of the Recommended Treatment </b></p>\n<p>It has been recommended that I have the following periodontal treatment (all that apply have been checked for me): </p><br><br>\n\n\n\n            <table style=\"width:100%\" class=\"\">\n                <tr style=\"width:100%\">\n                    <td align=\"left\" style=\"width:30%\">\n                        <div id=\"container\" align=\"left\" style=\"width:100%\">\n                                <table style=\"width:90%\">\n\n                                     <tr>\n                                        <td> Scaling and root planing</td>\n                                       <td>{{ doc.scaling_and_root_planing }}</td></div>\n                                    </tr> \n                                    <tr>\n                                        <td>Osseous (bone) surgery and recontouring</td>\n                                       <td>{{ doc.osseous__surgery_and_recontouring }}</td></div>\n                                    </tr> \n                                  \n                                  \n                                   \n                                                  \n                                </table>\n                        </div>\n                    </td>\n                     <td align=\"center\" style=\"width:30%\">\n                        <div id=\"container\" align=\"left\" style=\"width:100%\">\n                                <table align=\"right\" style=\"width:90%\">\n                                   \n                                    <tr>\n                                        <td>Gingivectomy (recontouring) </b></td>\n                            <td>{{doc.gingivitis_gingival_disease}}</td>\n                                    </tr>                 \n                                     <tr>\n                                        <td>Periodontal bone graft</b></td>\n                            <td>{{ doc.periodontal_bone_graft}} </td>\n                                    </tr>  \n                                      \n                                </table>\n                        </div>\n                    </td>\n\n\n\n                    <td align=\"right\" style=\"width:30%\">\n                        <div id=\"container\" align=\"left\" style=\"width:100%\">\n                                <table align=\"right\" style=\"width:90%\">\n                                   \n                                    <tr>\n                                        <td>Referral to a gum specialist (periodontist)   </b></td>\n                            <td>{{doc.referral_to_a_gum_specialist}}</td>\n                                    </tr>                 \n                                     <tr>\n                                        <td>Other   </b></td>\n                            <td>{{doc.other_perio}}</td>\n                                    </tr>                 \n                                    \n                                      \n                                      \n                                </table>\n                        </div>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </table>\n            <br>               </div>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b> Teeth or areas of each recommended treatment:</b></p><br>___________________________________________\n\nThis recommendation is based on visual examination, periodontal probing and charting, X-rays, other diagnostic tests, any models or photos taken, and on my doctor's knowledge of my medical and dental history.

recommended_____________________________________.<br><br>\nMy radiological imaging procedure  is estimated to cost Rs.____________. I understand that this is only an estimate and I will be informed as soon as possible if the cost estimate changes. <br><br>\nI have been explained that Panoramic dental X-ray/OPG/Lat Ceph use a very small dose of ionizing radiation to capture the entire mouth in one image. It is commonly performed procedure in everyday practice and gives a 2dimentional (2-D) image. Dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a special type of x-ray equipment used when regular dental or facial x-rays are not sufficient. This technology produces three dimensional (3-D) images of teeth, soft tissues, nerve pathways and bone in a single scan.<br><br></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b>Instructions :</b>I am aware and have been informed that prior to the examination, I may be asked to remove anything that may interfere with the imaging, including metal objects, such as jewellery, eyeglasses, hairpins and hearing aids including removable dental prosthesis.</p><br><br>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b>Procedure:</b> I have been explained that during a panoramic x-ray examination, the x-ray tube rotates in a semicircle around the patient's head, starting at one side of the jaw and ending at the other side. In CBCT examination, the C-arm or gantry rotates around the head in a complete 360-degree rotation while capturing multiple images from different angles that are reconstructed to create a single 3-D image. <br>I am aware that I will be situated in the center of the unit where the technician will carefully position me. A bite-blocker will be placed in my mouth to ensure proper alignment of the teeth. Correct placement of the teeth and head is important for obtaining a clear image. Also I am expected to remain very still while the rotating arm travels in a semicircle around the perimeter of my head when the images are being taken. This can typically last between 10 to 40 seconds.</p><br>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b>Declaration:</b>The risks involved and the possibility of complications if any during this procedure have been explained to me.</p> <br>\n\n  <table style=\"width:100%\" class=\"\">\n                <tr style=\"width:100%\">\n                    <td align=\"left\" style=\"width:30%\">\n                        <div id=\"container\" align=\"left\" style=\"width:100%\">\n                                <table style=\"width:90%\">\n\n                                     <tr>\n                                        <td>   I am not pregnant. </td>\n                                       <td>{{ doc.i_am_not_pregnant }}</td></div>\n                                    </tr> \n                                    <tr>\n                                        <td>I am a nursing mother</td>\n                                       <td>{{ doc.nursing_mother }}</td></div>\n                                    </tr> \n                                  \n                                  \n                                   \n                                                  \n                                </table>\n                        </div>\n                    </td>\n                     <td align=\"center\" style=\"width:30%\">\n                        <div id=\"container\" align=\"left\" style=\"width:100%\">\n                                <table align=\"right\" style=\"width:90%\">\n                                   \n                                    <tr>\n                                        <td>There could be a possibility that I could be pregnant.</b></td>\n                            <td>{{doc.could_be_pregnant}}</td>\n                                    </tr>                 \n                                     <tr>\n                                        <td>I am not Epileptic</td>\n                            <td>{{ doc.epileptic}} </td>\n                                    </tr>  \n                                      \n                                </table>\n                        </div>\n                    </td>\n\n\n\n                    <td align=\"right\" style=\"width:30%\">\n                        <div id=\"container\" align=\"left\" style=\"width:100%\">\n                                <table align=\"right\" style=\"width:90%\">\n                                   \n                                    <tr>\n                                        <td>I am  pregnant</b></td>\n                            <td>{{doc.pregnant}}</td>\n                                    </tr>                 \n                                     <tr>\n                                        <td> I am not Claustrophobic   </b></td>\n                            <td>{{doc.not_claustrophobic}}</td>\n                                    </tr>                 \n                                    \n                                      \n                                      \n                                </table>\n                        </div>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </table>\n          <br>\n               </div><br>\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b>Risks of Radiological imaging</b><br><br> \nI have been informed and completely understand that there are certain inherent and potential risks associated with radiological imaging. These risks are difficult to accurately measure, but it has been shown that the risk of developing cancer is slightly increased if one has been exposed to additional ionising radiation above background levels. The risks are not the same for all people; females and Children are slightly more sensitive to the effects of ionising radiation compared with males. Although there is a small risk of harm from ionising radiation, there could be a greater risk of not having the information. Operators of an X-ray machine have been trained to use only enough X-rays to provide quality pictures for the specialist. The dose of ionising radiation is therefore kept to a minimum.

Implants permit missing teeth to be replaced through the use of crowns, fixed bridges, or dentures, which attach to the top(s) of the implant(s). It has been recommended that I have a total of ____dental implant fixtures placed in the following tooth positions or areas of my<br>mouth:___________________________________________________________.</p> \n<p>This recommendation is based on visual examination(s), on any X-rays, models, photos and other diagnostic tests taken, and on my doctor's knowledge of my medical and dental history. My needs and desires have also been taken into consideration.<br><br>\nImplant placement surgery involves opening the gums and creating a hole in the jawbone for each dental implant. The dental implant is placed snugly in the custom hole created for it. The gums are then stitched closed over the implant. Follow-up visits are required. Following placement, implants require time to heal and attach to the surrounding bone before replacement teeth can be made to fasten on top of them. I understand my expected healing time will be_________ months. During this time, I may be without replacement teeth. A second surgery is then necessary to uncover the implant and prepare it for use. <br><br>\nThe prognosis, or likelihood of success, of this procedure is _____________________________.<br>\nHowever, I understand that no guarantee, warrantee, or assurance has been given to me that this treatment will be successful, or for how long. <br><br>\nMy implant(s) is (are) estimated to cost Rs._________ and estimated to take _________ visit(s) to complete. After implant placement, it is estimated that I will be able to proceed replacing my missing teeth in_________ months. <br><br>\nTo follow the given advice during and after the treatment is my committed responsibility. <br></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b>Alternatives to Implant Placement Surgery:</b></p><p> Depending on the condition of my mouth and my current diagnosis, there may be other treatment alternatives to implant placement and implant-supported tooth replacement. I understand that possible alternatives to an implant-supported prosthesis may be: </p><br>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b>\u25a1  Replacement of the missing tooth or teeth by a tooth-supported fixed bridge.</b></p><p> Natural teeth next to the toothless space are used to support a bridge, which is cemented into place and is non-removable. This procedure requires drilling the natural teeth to properly shape them to support the fixed bridge. </p><br>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b>\u25a1  Replacement of the missing tooth or teeth by a removable partial denture or full denture.</b></p><p> Partial and full dentures are removed from the mouth for cleaning. </p><br>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b>\u25a1   No treatment.</b></p><p> I may decide not to replace the missing tooth or teeth. If I decide upon no treatment, my teeth may shift overtime, causing chewing or gum problems.<br><br> \nI have had an opportunity to ask questions about these alternatives and any other treatments I have heard or thought about, including ____________________________________________.</p><br><br>\n<p style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><b>Risks of Implant Placement Surgery:</b></p><p> I have been informed and fully understand that there are certain inherent and potential risks associated with any type of surgical procedure, including surgical implant placement. I understand that during and following treatment, I may experience pain or discomfort, bleeding, swelling, and/or bruising, all of which may last for several days. I understand that it is possible for an infection to occur in or around the implant site and that I may need antibiotics and/or other procedures to treat the infection. I understand that less common complications include: injury to the adjacent teeth and soft tissues; jaw fractures; sinus exposure and sinus infection (upper arch); limited ability to fully open your mouth; soreness in the jaw joints (TMJs). </p><br><br><br><br>\n<p style=\"text-align: right\">{{ frappe.db.get_value(\"Patient\", doc.patient, \"patient_name\") }}<br>\nPatient's Name & Signature</p><br>\n\n\n{% endif %}\n    </div>\n\n\n",
