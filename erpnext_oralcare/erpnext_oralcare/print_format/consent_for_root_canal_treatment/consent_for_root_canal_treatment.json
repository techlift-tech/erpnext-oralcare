It is done by first making an opening through tile chewing surface of the tooth to gain access to the tooth's pulp. The contents of the canals are removed and the canals cleaned and shaped. The canals are then filled and sealed with an inert material. Following root canal treatment, the tooth will need a final restoration, usually a crown, to return it to proper function. The final restoration is not part of this discussion and consent.\\n<br><br>\\nThis recommendation is based on visual examination(s), on any X-rays, models, photos and other diagnostic tests taken, and on my doctor's knowledge of my medical and dental history.
