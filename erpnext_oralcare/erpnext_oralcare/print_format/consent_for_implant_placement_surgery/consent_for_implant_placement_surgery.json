Implants permit missing teeth to be replaced through the use of crowns, fixed bridges, or dentures, which attach to the top(s) of the implant(s). It has been recommended that I have a total of________ dental implant fixtures placed in the following tooth positions or areas of my mouth:________________________________________\\n<br><br>\\n\\nThis recommendation is based on visual examination(s), on any X-rays, models, photos and other diagnostic tests taken, and on my doctor's knowledge of my medical and dental history. My needs and desires have also been taken into consideration.\\n<br><br>\\nImplant placement surgery involves opening the gums and creating a hole in the jawbone for each dental implant. The dental implant is placed snugly in the custom hole created for it. The gums are then stitched closed over the implant. Follow-up visits are required. Following placement, implants require time to heal and attach to the surrounding bone before replacement teeth can be made to fasten on top of them. I understand my expected healing time will_______ be months. During this time, I may be without replacement teeth. A second surgery is then necessary to uncover the implant and prepare it for use.<br>\", \"fieldname\": \"_custom_html\", \"fieldtype\": \"HTML\", \"label\": \"Custom HTML\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"options\": \"<br><br>\\nThe prognosis, or likelihood of success, of this procedure is_______________________________\\n<br><br>\\nHowever, I understand that no guarantee, warrantee, or assurance has been given to me that this treatment will be successful, or for how long.\\n<br><br>\\n\\nMy implant(s) is (are) estimated to cost Rs_________.and estimated to take _________ visit(s) to complete. After implant placement, it is estimated that I will be able to proceed replacing my missing teeth in________months.\\n<br><br>\\nTo follow the given advice during and after the treatment is my committed responsibility.\\n<br><br>\\n<b>Alternatives to Implant Placement Surgery:</b> Depending on the condition of my mouth and my current diagnosis, there may be other treatment alternatives to implant placement and implant-supported tooth replacement. I understand that possible alternatives to an implant-supported prosthesis may be:\\n<br><br>\\n<b>Replacement of the missing tooth or teeth by a tooth-supported fixed bridge:</b> Natural teeth next to the toothless space are used to support a bridge, which is cemented into place and is non-removable. This procedure requires drilling the natural teeth to properly shape them to support the fixed bridge.<br>\", \"fieldname\": \"_custom_html\", \"fieldtype\": \"HTML\", \"label\": \"Custom HTML\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Section Break\", \"label\": \"\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Column Break\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"options\": \"<b>Replacement of the missing tooth or teeth by a removable partial denture or full denture:</b> Partial and full dentures are removed from the mouth for cleaning.\\n<br><br>\\n<b> No treatment:</b> I may decide not to replace the missing tooth or teeth.

I understand that it is possible for an infection to occur in or around the implant site and that I may need antibiotics and/or other procedures to treat the infection. I understand that less common complications include: injury to the adjacent teeth and soft tissues; jaw fractures; sinus exposure and sinus infection (upper arch); limited ability to fully open your mouth; soreness in the jaw joints (TMJs).<br><br>\", \"fieldname\": \"_custom_html\", \"fieldtype\": \"HTML\", \"label\": \"Custom HTML\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Section Break\", \"label\": \"\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Column Break\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Column Break\"}, {\"fieldtype\": \"Column Break\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"options\": \"<br>{{doc.patient}}<br>\\n{{doc.date}}\", \"fieldname\": \"_custom_html\", \"fieldtype\": \"HTML\", \"label\": \"Custom HTML\"}, {\"print_hide\": 0, \"options\": \"Patient's Name & Signature\", \"fieldname\": \"_custom_html\", \"fieldtype\": \"HTML\", \"label\": \"Custom HTML\"}]",
